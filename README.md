# Simple todo app in React

link: http://todos.jakubwierzchowski.tech/

This project was created in few days to showcase my React skills, I was trying to use as many React concepts as possible.

## How to use app?

I`ve used TypeScript because it's build on top of JavaScript so if I know typescript I also know JavaScript.

I`ve implemented simple todos sync system, with backend written in Node.js([link to backend repo])

How to use sync system?
1. click on "cloud sync icon"
2. generate random sync code or enter your own
3. Click checkmark icon(âœ…)

If there are no todos displayed app will fetch todos from server but if there are some, app will send this todos to the server

## App schema
App uses two separated docker containers - one with compiled frontend( with serve -s command ), and second one running backend api written in Node.js. Both of them are behind Apache2 web server configured for beeing proxy.

Backend have three endpoints:
- /generateToken
- /uploadTodos
- /getTodos?syncToken=[sync token]
